Amphitheatre - World History Encyclopedia
An amphitheatre is a type of structure typically used for entertainment, characterized by a central arena surrounded by tiered seating. It's often an outdoor venue, but can also be indoors. Historically, amphitheatres were used for events like gladiatorial contests and spectacles in Ancient Rome. Modern amphitheatres are used for concerts, plays, and other public performances. 
Here's a more detailed description:
Structure:
Amphitheatres are generally circular or oval, with rows of seats rising around a central open space (the arena). 
Function:
They are designed for large gatherings of people to watch events, such as sports, concerts, or plays. 
Historical Significance:
The term "amphitheatre" comes from the Greek word for "theater with seats on all sides," reflecting their original use in ancient Greece and Rome. 
Modern Usage:
While the term is often used for open-air venues, it can also describe structures with sloping seating, including lecture halls and some modern theaters. 
Examples:
The Colosseum in Rome is a famous example of a Roman amphitheatre. Modern examples include outdoor concert venues, sports stadiums, and even some lecture halls.
